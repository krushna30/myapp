              Many companies opt to invest in custom app development to either
              improve work efficiency and streamline internal processes or push
              their ideas to the open market.
              <br />
              When creating an app, developers must consider a variety of
              elements, such as screen size, configurations, and hardware
              specifications. Each component of a mobile app must come together
              to provide the end-user with a fast, clean, and easy-to-use
              interface design. Here are a few other things you will want to
              consider during app development

                </li>
              </a>
              has become increasingly popular in the last few years.
              Cross-platform technologies allow developers to write code just
              once before releasing it to all platforms, including iOS, Android
              and Windows. This means that instead of writing a fresh code for
              each individual platform, app developers can reuse the same code.
              This helps to save time and cut down on repetitive tasks.
              <br />
              Cross-platform app development can also help businesses control
              costs. Companies now only need to make one investment to create an
              app instead of having to use numerous tools and technologies to
              accommodate all platforms. When cross-platform app development is
              used, end users can benefit from consistency. The app should look
              the same on all devices, regardless of the user is on an Android
              phone or an iPad.

              So ,you have a mobile app you would like to build. The first
              question you need to ask yourself is what kind of app is it going
              to be? Native? Hybrid? Web? What is the difference and how should
              you choose?
              <br />
              Building a mobile app involves a lot more choices varying from the
              design, type, prospective user and their experience. A lot of
              those decisions boil down to whether you want to develop a mobile
              app or a progressive web app. If you ended up on this post you
              most likely decided on a mobile app. One of the advantages of this
              solution include an icon on the user’s screen that encourage
              repeated use. Another reason might be that the product needs to
              integrate with the device’s operating system to cache data or
              connect to Bluetooth for IoT (Internet of Things).
              <br />
              We hope the guide below will help you make an informed decision
              that will benefit the user experience and not elevate the costs
              and time of development.

              Objective-C is the older and currently more favoured language. It
              is a bit more difficult to learn, but the majority of experienced
              developers are already familiar with it. Swift is still new but it
              is growing more and more popular. It is easier to learn, but with
              that said, it isn’t recommended for big projects.

                    One of the biggest advantages of building a native app is
                    the fact that it makes use of the device’s security, speed
                    and specific features in full
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Native code runs fastest for on-screen interactions or
                    processing data that is stored locally.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The user experience is usually much better due to the fact
                    that the app looks and acts like other apps on the user’s
                    device. Moreover, an access to wide range of APIs puts no
                    limitation on app usage.

                  The biggest disadvantage to building native apps is the cost.
                  The developers must build a separate app for every operating
                  system. This means you might need separate developers for each
                  platform that you want your app to work on.

                <li>
                  1. Instead of building multiple native apps for each operating
                  system, you are only building one core app and only modifying
                  it to work on all platforms
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Lower cost of development, faster and easier updates and
                  lower maintenance cost
                </li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4 className="hl" id ="hybriddisad">Disdvantages of Building Hybrid Apps</h4>
                <li>
                  1. One of the biggest disadvantages of hybrid apps is their
                  performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Sometimes the total cost of developing and maintaining the
                  app may reach the cost of developing separate native apps,
                  thus rendering the cost benefits negligible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. It seems the same goes for time - a hybrid app may take
                  less time to develop but if it is complicated and you want it
                  to look right on different operating systems - it will likely
                  take even more time than native development.

              {" "}
              In 2015, designer Frances Berriman and Google Chrome engineer Alex
              Russell coined the term “progressive web apps” to describe apps
              taking advantage of new features supported by modern browsers,
              including service workers and web app manifests, that let users
              upgrade web apps to progressive web applications in their native
              operating system.
              <br />
              <br/>
              Progressive web applications (PWAs) are web applications that load
              like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user
              functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and
              device hardware access that used to only be available in native
              mobile applications. PWAs are an emerging technology that combine
              the open standards of the web offered by modern browsers and the
              benefits of a rich mobile experience. Simply put - PWAs are mobile
              sites, designed to work like a native app.
              <br />
              <br/>
              Unfortunately, PWA are still relatively new and not broadly
              supported (Android only started supporting it in 2017 with Apple
              following mid-2018).
              <br />
              <br/>
              As the technology improves, there definitely emerge some good use
              cases for PWAs. For instance, large social media sites are a good
              example of something that would do well as a PWA. Twitter Lite and
              Pinterest both demonstrate how you can bring your mobile web
              experience almost on par with your native app, which would work
              well in markets with poor or expensive connectivity.
